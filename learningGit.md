# Personal Notes
## Learning Git Basics
I am learning how to use Git by following the recommended tutorials and exercises provided. Here’s what I’ve learned so far:

- Cloning repositories to my local computer.
- Committing changes using Git with meaningful commit messages.
- Viewing changes with `git diff`.
- Syncing changes between my local repository and GitHub.

I have also played with commit commands and practiced fixing typos in my documents.

## Goals
- Improve my ability to work with Git in stats classes.
- Practice collaboration on GitHub.
  
## Action Items
- Watch GitHub training videos.
- Work on completing homework through Git.
- Learn branching and merging techniques.

## Experimenting with Commits
1. **Introduced a typo** – Added and committed the typo.
2. **Corrected the typo** – Committed the correction and left an informative message.
3. **Checked differences** using `git diff` – Reviewed the changes between commits.

# Git Commands Cheat Sheet

Here are the main commands I used to complete the exercises:

- **`git clone`**: Cloned a repository to my local computer.
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sw24f/jump-start-with-git-ZetongFang420.git
